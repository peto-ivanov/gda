jetted to the weed house \nSmoked out 'til I started bustin' freestyles\nBroke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick\nCrushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick\nMade a couple of crank calls collect\n\"Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?\"\nI wanna make songs on a fellas dub\nAnd murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of\n\nSo just remember when I bomb your set\nYo, I only cuss to make your mom upset\nCum on everybody, get down tonight\nCum on everybody, get down tonight\nCum on everybody, get down tonight\nCum on everybody, get down tonight\nCum on

\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI never seen no shit like this is my life before \nPeople will still camp out from the night before \nSleepin' outside the door waitin' in line \nStill tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform \nThe fire marshals no, the venue's too small \nPeople are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans \nAnd some come walk from out the parkin' lot \nGet into an argument over a parkin' spot \nHe's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off \nMissed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door \nIn St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place \nSprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall \nBefore anyone could even hear the first shot go off \nI'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff \nBullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off \nThank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun \nAnd where the f*ck is Von he usually tucks one on him \nWait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre \nNah I guess not, what the f*ck oh my god it was \nI never saw him run so fast in my life \nLook at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife \nThere she is on the ground bein' trampled \nI go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her \nGod damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit \nMy vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin \nIf I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep \nFollow Bizarre's path and ran through it \nAnd made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps \nLooked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out \nBut I can't see who he's shootin' it out with \nBut Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth \n\n[Chorus]\n\nIt's Friday night came to this bitch right \nBig ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right \nI ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight \nAlthough I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight \nThat's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge \nShot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in \nSwift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker\nShoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker \nSo one shot for the money two's to stop the show \nThird's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go \n(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi) \nHe tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece \n\n[Chorus]","492":"Shady\nAftermath\nHa ha\nG-G-G-G-Unit\nHa ha\n\n'Cause we

ways to word the same, old song\nEver since I came along\nFrom the day the song called \"Hi! My Name Is\" dropped\nStarted thinking my name was fault\n'Cause anytime things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg\nGangsta? Naw, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I've been against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\nDo I really belong in this game? I pondered\nI just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\nAnd keep pluggin', it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that

like, I was there once, single parents\nHate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on\nThat I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a f*ck\"\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in the trailer park?\nAnd the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in\nAnd I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun\nSo to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song\nBut I'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than making another mothafuckin' \"We Made You\" uh\nNow I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just opened enough eyes later on\nGave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you

walk\nBut thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium\nAt least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was

big, but it ain't when you can't leave it\nAnd I feel so isolated, nice I made it\nBut it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it\nSo I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it\nThen I wonder why I'm still famous\nI keep walkin' the line\nThis gold fish poke it's old\nBut especially when you don't know\nIf your conscience is sayin' I told you so\n'Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier\nOr you sold your soul\n\nIt's a fine, fine line\n\nAnd from here you look so small\nHovering high above us all\nPlease come back, to me\n\nI

if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut f*ck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women, how the f*ck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for (Satan)\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard, be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a God?","628":"Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws\nEminem\nMarshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper, Eminem\nWho can say for sure?\nPerhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer\nIf science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use\nSociety will reap a great benefit\n\nI walk around like a space cadet, place your bets\nWho's likely to become a serial killer?

to work, you and momma had to leave me\r\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it\r\nAnd you and Laney were to young to understand it\r\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\r\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\r\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\r\nCause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\r\nNow I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\r\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\r\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\r\nWow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\r\nLaney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\r\nI like the sound of that, yeah\r\nIt's got a ring to it don't it?\r\nShh, momma's only gone for the moment\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\nAnd if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\r\nI'mma give you the world\r\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you\r\nI'mma sing for you\r\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\r\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\r\nI'mma break that birdies neck\r\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\r\nAnd make him

it?\nI dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music\nI started off underground in a dark room\nWith a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon\nThat transform to a pen in case of a words war\nAnd opened the first door that led to the first floor\nI got attacked by a couple of rap acts\nThey wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks\nI hit one over the head with a broken verb\nThe muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word\nBut it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys\nAnd disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise\nI used up four bars but I earned a punchline\nAnd proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned\n\n[Chorus]\nWe don't play those games\nWould you listen here?\nWhat I'm doin he're?\nGet me outta here\n\nWe don't play those games\nThis is

the run\nRap 2K1\n\nI got attacked right away when I walked in\nBy a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen\nI put up my force shield to block any attempt\nAt this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent\nThe floor opened up and I almost fell inside\nBut I used my mic right, I swung to the other side\nAnd just when I thought I avoided the booby trap\nI got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag\nAnd this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle\nBut I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle\nWhoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you\nI killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU\nA record exec then appeared in a black limo\nAnd started to attack with a bag full of wack demos\nAnd I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill\nSo I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI made it to the next level: Above Ground\nMy soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound\nI pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked\nAnd that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock\nAnd start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll\nCause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul\nI hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly\nHis street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me\nIt took a while to finish em all but I finally did it\nThen out comes this powerful beast known as the critic\nWith a fully loaded magazine and mad drama\nMy harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor\nNow I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves\nI'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades\nBut he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower\nSo I jumped through the blades and I died, game over\n\n[Chorus]","1038":"As we proceed to give you what you need. \nRay J, Raz B, J- boog, Lil'

other, in time we discovered that we have more in common\nThen we thought with each other\nBoth robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us\nWhat was wrong with us, was it our fault?\n'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us\nTwo odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time\nWhat a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica\nQueens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause\nBig L had just got popped just a month before\nIf 50 lives he's gettin' dropped from Columbia\nTwo years later, me and Doc had to come and uh, operate\nThat's when he popped up at number one\nAnd we ain't never gonna stop if you're wonderin'\nEven if I'm under the gun\nYou ain't gotta agree all the time with me or see eye to eye\nThere'll always be animosity between you and

am I so misunderstood?\nWhy do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit,\nWoe is me, there goes poor Marshall again\nWhining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in\nFrom the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad\nAnd how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it\nMan I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it\nI can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard\nNeeds to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it\n\n[Chorus]\n\nEvil deeds, while I plant these evil

caused\nThis Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again\nWhat did I do that was so bad to deserve this\nEverything could have been so perfect\nBut life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air\nForty feet below me, there's people everywhere\nI don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel\nAnd all I wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel\nWithout this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round\nHere we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now\nRing around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now\nBut the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be\nWhere's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be\nSo please god, give

you make me sick\nYou're truly the only one who can do this to me\nYou just make me get so crazy\nI go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic\nOne minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex\nYou make me crazy\nThe way we act like two maniacs in the sack\nWe f*** like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit\n'Cause the next day we right back at it\nIn the same exact pattern\nWhat the f*** is the matter with us\nWe can't figure out if it's lust\nOr it's love which that is attractin' us to each other\nThey say that every man grows up to marry his own mother\nWhich would explain why you're such a motherf***in' b****\nBut I stay and still stick it out with you\nEven though I just hit you today but you deserved it\nYou hit me first and provoked me to choke you\nJust 'cause I came home late last night\nCrawled in bed and I woke you\nBut if there's one thing about you that I admire\nIt's baby, because you stay with me\nMaybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am\n'Cause when I look at you\nI can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside\nI see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise\nYou're always full of surprises\nAlways pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos\nYou f***ed yourself so much you barely feel those anymore\nYou're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature\nThan those other little hoes who just act like little girls\nLike they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool\nChill you play your position you never step out of line\nEven though I stay in your business\nYou've always kept out of mine\nI wonder what's on your mind\nSometimes they say love is blind\nMaybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye\nYou didn't see the sign\nOr maybe you did maybe you like being shoved\nMaybe cause we're crazy in love\n\nLet me go crazy on you\nCrazy on you\nLet me go crazy, crazy on you, oh\nYou are the ink to my paper\nWhat my pen is to my my pad\nThe moral, the very fiber\nThe whole substance to my rap\nYou are my reason for being\nThe meaning of my existence\nIf it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this\nAs intense as I do, and the irony\nIs you rely on me as much\nAs I rely on you to inspire me like you do\nYou provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire\nYou're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter\nThe only way that I'm able to stay so stable\nIs you're the legs to my table,\nIf you were to break I'd fall on my face\nBut I'm always gonna make you feel\nI don't need you as much as I really need you\nSo you don't use it to your advantage\nBut you're essential to me\nYou're the air I breathe\nI believe if you ever leave me\nI'd probably have no reason to be\nYou are the Kim to my Marshall\nYou're the Slim to my Shady\nThe Dre to my Eminem\nThe Alana to my Hailie\nYou are the word that I'm lookin for\nWhen I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside\nAnd the right one just won't come to my mind\nYou're like the pillar that props me up\nThe beam that supports me\nThe b**** who never took half\nThe wife who never divorced me\nYou're like the root to my evil\nYou let my devil come out me\nYou let me beat the s*** out you before you beat the s*** out me\nAnd no matter how much too much is never enough\nMaybe 'cause we're crazy in love\n\nLet me go crazy on you\nCrazy on you\nLet me go Crazy, crazy on you
